        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>Games have a mix of shared and unique jargon that can be confusing to navigate at first. We will breakdown the various terms so that you can understand what other people are talking about.</p>
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p><strong>Challenge Run</strong>- a play through of a video game with additional rules applied. These rules can be quite varied, but usually revolve around increased difficulty, limit breaking, or both.</p>
        <p><strong>Speedrun</strong>- A common form of challenge run where the goal is to reach a goal as fast as possible. This type of run is unique as runner's submit times to user boards and compete for the best time. By default, the use of glitches and exploits is expected.</p>
        <p><strong>Any%</strong>- A type of speedrun where the goal is to reach the game's end credits as fast as possible. Completing game content is secondary to time.</p>
        <p><strong>100%</strong>- A type of speedrun where the goal is to complete all game objectives as fast as possible. Completing game content is required.</p>
        <p><strong>Glitchless</strong>- An additional rule that is applied to some speedruns forbidding what the community has defined as a glitch or exploit. Each community has a list of what is and is not a glitch for their game. Most communities or links to them can be found at <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/" target="_blank">Speedrun.com</a></p>
        <p><strong>Iron Man</strong>- A single life run where the challenge is to reach an end goal without being killed. Generally involved Player vs Player content.</p>
        
        <h3>Pokemon</h3>
        <p><strong>Nuzlocke</strong>- A challenge run that heavily restricts the player. Rules vary from player to player with a core set of rules.</p>
        <div id="nuzlocke_rules">
            <p>1. A player may only catch one Pokemon per uniquely named area.</p>
            <p>2. The player can only catch the first Pokemon they encounter in that area. The player cannot catch any other Pokemon they encounter, even if they are the same species as the first one.</p>
            <p>3. If a Pokemon is defeated in battle, that Pokemon is considered 'dead' and cannot be used for the rest of the run.</p>
            <p>Runs mentioned on this site will generally have additional rules.</p>
        </div> 
        <p><strong>Shiny Clause</strong>- Pokemon have a 1/4000-ish chance to have a different color. These are called Shiny Pokemon. If Shiny Clause is in effect, the player may catch a Shiny Pokemon they encounter regardless of rules 1 and 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Hardcore</strong>- An additional rule that adds two stipulations. The player may not use any healing items in battle and the player must play on Set mode or decline the offer to switch out their Pokemon when defeating another Pokemon.</p>
        <p><strong>Set Mode</strong>- An option found in Pokemon games. When defeating a Pokemon, the game will usually announce the next Pokemon to be sent in and allow the player to switch out theirs. When Set Mode is enabled, the player is not given this chance and the next enemy Pokemon is automatically sent in. This option is absent in newer titles.</p>
        <p><strong>Generation</strong>- A generation in Pokemon is marked by a paired release that introduces a large number of new Pokemon.</p>
        
        <h3>Dark Souls</h3>
        <p><strong>RTSR</strong>- The Red Tearstone Ring. This item gives a boost to attack power when worn at low health.</p>
        <p><strong>Hyper Mode</strong>- A combination of RTSR and the spell Power Within which boosts attack power while slowly burning the player. When used together the player does considerably more damage until Power Within wears off.</p>
        <p><strong>FAP Ring</strong>- The Ring of Favor and Protection. Gives a generous boost to several stats with the downside being that the ring becomes unusable when removed.</p>
        <p><strong>NG+</strong>- Officially called New Game Plus. Enemies and bosses have more hp and deal more damage as well as offering more currency when killed. Addtional items and enemies may be present depending on which Dark Souls game you are playing.</p>
        <p><strong>Scholar of the First Sin</strong>- Dark Souls 2 has two different versions, the original release and Scholar of the First Sin. Scholar of the First Sin is considered the harder version with significant changes to enemy and item placement. There are no major differences between other versions of the Dark Souls games.</p>

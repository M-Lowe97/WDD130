            <h2>Pokemon: Cross Generation Nuzlock Marathon</h2>
            <p>The goal of this nuzlock is simple, beat the champion of each generation of pokemon in sequential order. The Run starts in Pokemon Yellow and ends in Pokemon Scarlet. Normal Nuzlock rules apply with two major changes:</p>
            <p>1. Any pokemon caught cannot be used in subsequent games. If you get that Charzard in Yellow, you can't use it in X/Y. This applies to evolution stages that are added in later games. Once you catch an Eevee, that's it for every one of its evolution options.</p>
            <p>2. If you wipe out, you update your capture list and roll back to the previous game. This rule is more for your benefit than adding layers to the challenge. No one wants to go from Ultra Sun to Yellow cause of one mistake.</p>
            <p>Other than these rules, there are some clarifications, Generations 1, 2, 3, and 4 will use the third release. Generation 5 will use Black 2/White 2. Generation 7 will use Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon. DLC content for Generations 8 and 9 are optional as they are not required to complete the base game.</p>

            <h4>Current Progress</h4>
            <p>Best Attempt: Pokemon Platinum</p>
            <p>Current Run: Pokemon Emerald</p>
            <p>Total Wipe Outs (losses to Yellow): 15</p>

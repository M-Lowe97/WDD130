        <p>At 27 years old, Michael has had the opprotunity to enjoy a wide variety of games with a particular fondness for the RPG genre and its many variants. Challenge runs were initially a way to squeeze a few more hours out of expensive games, but he has since found that the sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming a particularly difficult challenge to be rewarding. As a new father, this evolution of his hobby allows him to balance his responsibilities without feeling like he needs the next big game.</p>

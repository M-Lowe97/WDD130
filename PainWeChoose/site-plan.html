      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        The home page will be simple. The Pain We Choose is a challenge run archive where the various video game
        challenges taken on by my brother and I are tracked and documented. Challenges are 'issued' by a mutual friend of
        ours who also assigns a small reward to be given upon completion. Runs are only valid if both parties agree to the rules of the run.
        This site is largely for personal use, however in time it will grow to host a variety of interesting challenge ideas
        and documentation of roadblocks and solutions with the ultimate goal of acting as a resource the others can use for 
        making and planning their own challenges.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>A bit of the video game back ground of the challengers. List of all pending, current, and completed challenges
        undertaken. The explaination of the rules will be through but will not break down community specific words, that content will be 
        on page 3. Notable roadblocks will be mentioned along with methods that were used in an attempt to overcome them and if they were successful.
        Falied runs will be more throughly documented in hopes of being revisited in a more neutral mental state.

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        Page 3 is a more detailed breakdown of the rules. It will accomplish this by acting as a dictionary for page 2. Terms will be 
        grouped by the game or challenge type it applied to and have a definition or detailed list depending on what is better suited.
        Example of a definition:
        Any% - a playthrough of a video game focused on getting to the credits of the game as fast as possible while doing only
        required content.

        Example of a breakdown:
        Nuzlocke - A popular Pokemon challenge that focuses on a series of self-impossed rules. The most common are limited encounters, Duplicates clause, and Pokemon deaths.
          Limited Encounters - players are limited to one new pokemon per map location. Players are only allowed the first encounter in that location
          unless it violated the Duplicates clause.
          Duplicates Clause - The player can only use unique Pokemon species. If the player encounters a member of a species they 
          already caught then they must reroll the encounter for that location. If there are no unique species then the player loses the encounter.
          Pokemon Deaths - once a Pokemon has been reduced to 0 HP, they cannot be revived and must be either released or placed in the player's 
          PC seperated from 'Live' Pokemon. Exceptions can be made for early game losses due to moves that deal a fixed amount of damage that is more
          than the maximum hp of the pokemon party.
            Pokemon Deaths sub clause - a total party wipe is considered a loss and the game is reset to the beginning.
